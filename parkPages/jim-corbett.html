            The Indian state of Uttarakhand is home to the famed wildlife refuge
            known as Jim Corbett National Park. <br />
            It was founded in 1936 and is one of India's first national parks.
            Jim Corbett, a British-Indian hunter, naturalist, and novelist who
            was instrumental in the creation of the park, is the subject of the
            park's name. <br />

            The park is home to a broad range of plants and fauna and is
            renowned for its high biodiversity. Bengal tigers, leopards,
            elephants, sloth bears, deer, wild boars, and various bird species
            are just a few of the notable wildlife species that may be found
            here. One of the best spots in India to see these majestic big cats
            can be found in this park, which is particularly well-known for its
            tiger population.
