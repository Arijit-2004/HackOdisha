            The state of Kerala in southern India is home to the well-known wildlife sanctuary and national park known as Periyar. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the most notable and well-preserved protected areas in the Western Ghats.<br>
             The Periyar River, which runs through the area and is important to the ecosystem, inspired the park's name.

            The Mullaperiyar Dam's construction across the Periyar River created the Periyar Lake, which serves as the park's focal point. The lake is a well-liked location for boat safaris and wildlife viewing since it draws a wide variety of wildlife.
